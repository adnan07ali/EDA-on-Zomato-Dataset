# EDA-on-Zomato-Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Zomato! Here, we perform in-depth analysis on Zomato data using Python queries to extract valuable insights.

Zomato is a popular online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato's dataset. EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data, often with visual methods, to better understand its structure, patterns, and relationships.
